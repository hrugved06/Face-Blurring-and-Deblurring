# Face Detection and Blurring

**GOAL:**

In this project we will play with an image to detect the faces and then we will apply the blurr effect on some part of that image. This project will be done with the help of some libraries like tensorflow, opencv, matplotlib, numpy, mtcnn using Python programming.

**DATASET:**

No dataset needed for this project. Instead we will be using image of our choice.

**WHAT I HAD DONE:**

I have created a project in which we will detect some faces and then will apply the blurr effect on them. 
First We will read/load the required images for for this project and then getting the coordinates for different parts of faces present in the image.

Then drawing a rectangle using X , Y axes and then displaying the face with a boundary box.

After getting the proper coordinates for all the faces in image we will apply the blurring effect using the height (h) and width (w) coordinates.

And then using the for loop we are blurring each face present in the image and finally saving & displaying the snapchat filtered image.

**MODELS USED:**

We are not using any model for performing this task.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED:**
- Tensorflow
- MTCNN
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

**WORKING:**

To start using this project, follow the below guidelines: 

**1.**  Fork this project/repository.

**2.**  Clone your forked copy of the project/repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ML-ProjectKart.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory  

```
cd ML-ProjectKart/Face Detection and Blurring/
```

**4.** Install the `requirements.txt` using command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5.** Run `face_detection_and_blurring.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook or any other platform ðŸ’»

**CONCLUSION:**

Finally, we have created a project in which we have detected some faces and then applied the blurr effect on them. And we have also learnt how to work with such type of blurring effects and we can blurr any part of image in this way, the output we got with this project is also attached here.
